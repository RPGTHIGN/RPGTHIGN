Main Ideas to early story line I'll add more detail to other areas as I think of them.

1. You start off in your home town which is a peaceful village far from any harm or danger.

2. One day the world becomes dark and stormy and minutes later you look on as black robed men walk into your town and to your horror they begin killing everyone and you are knocked out in the scuffle

3. You awake to your town completley burned and none of the villagers have survived the attack.

4. Amongst the rubble you find basic equipment (like a sword and basic armor) and to your surprise an old man who is barely alive.

5. Desperatley seeking aid from a village nearby and fending off deadly mutated mushrooms (SHOCK HORROR) the old man recovers and tells you his story of what happened.

6. You learn that the old man overheard a conversation before he was injured about where the black robed men were heading and seeking vengence you head out after them with the old man.

7. What follows is your basic dectective quests finding info in towns doing favours to gain knowledge of where the men went next etc.

8. When you eventually find the robed men you find out that the old man is actually the leader of the group who destroyed your village (Oh the humanity!)

9. You find out that the men were tracking a strange dark power that they suspected had taken over the villagers minds except for you and they had no choice but to kill them.

10. Reluctantly you agree to help them for the meanwhile to answer the question of why they left you alone.

That's all I got stay tuned for more :P
