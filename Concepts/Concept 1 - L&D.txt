 - after X years of this war a chold was born one who had the powers of light and darkness in perfect balance, child every born had, had this quality before.
 
 - as the child grew, many attempts where made to kidnap the child on both side since they could use this child to attack the stronghold of there enemies because he wouldn't be weakened
 
 - after the child grew to age X, and found out about the endless war they set out to stop both sides by attacking side and gaining control of both pieces of the scales.
 
 - finding the middle of the two countries he set out with the scale in hand.
 
 - when he reached the place he found it full on stones that had absorbs the light and darkness from the surronding area after finding two pieces that where the exact same weight he put them on each side of the the scale glowed a greyish colour creating a giant temple around the area of stones the light spread around the two war countries cause them to stop and thus the age of peace began!
 
 -  once every X years you a person was born who share the same control of the light and darkness who job was to again choose 2 stones of light and darkness of the same weight.
