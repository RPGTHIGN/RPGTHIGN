History

 - long ago 2 countries where waging a endless war, each side had a magical thing (half of the scale) that increased there sides power and decrease the other sides when near the device both where held in the main stronghold of the side

 - after X years of this war a chold was born one who had the powers of light and darkness in perfect balance, child every born had, had this quality before.
 
 - as the child grew, many attempts where made to kidnap the child on both side since they could use this child to attack the stronghold of there enemies because he wouldn't be weakened
 
 - after the child grew to age X, and found out about the endless war they set out to stop both sides by attacking side and gaining control of both pieces of the scales.
 
 - finding the middle of the two countries he set out with the scale in hand.
 
 - when he reached the place he found it full on stones that had absorbs the light and darkness from the surronding area after finding two pieces that where the exact same weight he put them on each side of the the scale glowed a greyish colour creating a giant temple around the area of stones the light spread around the two war countries cause them to stop and thus the age of peace began!
 
 -  once every X years you a person was born who share the same control of the light and darkness who job was to again choose 2 stones of light and darkness of the same weight.


Enviroment

 - Temple holding scale is in the middle of two countries one houses light peoples and the other houses darkness people (durr)
 
 - most people are peaceful in both countries only a few people who have been persaded by Y or are a bit too greedy will attack you (wildlife too :P)

 - light area will have alot open areas full of grassland, lakes, and high mountains also night doesnt fall in the light area

 - the darkness area on the surface is always dark or a dark blue brightness (is that possible?) will be full of deep caves that hold cities, ruins, etc.
 
 - the final area while be a repica of the temple which the scale was held in but when you enter is will be warped.

Boss ideas

 - A "holy" Knight (light) who is opressing people and using the term "justice" to murder people in cold blood
 
 - A mage who has become corrupt with power (light or darkness) and is slautering villages looking for strong people to battle.
 
 - A massive gargoyle (darkness) who is a minion of Y and guards a darkness piece of the scale (which makes him stronger).
 

Abilities

- Magic will have "tier" an depending on what form of power they are from they can be called either (X is the name of magic):
	+ Normal X, then Bright, then luminous, then blinding and then Holy for light-based.
	+ Normal X, then Faint, then Gloomy, then Dusk and then Sunless for darkness-based.
 
 - element lean towards either light or darkness
 	+ Fire, Wind, Lightning are light-based
	+ ice, Earth, Water are darkness-based
 

Misc

 - The scale is half gold with a white thread holding the weight part, the other half is silver (darkness) with a black thread.

 - Light and Darkness are not element but forms of power.
 
 - each person can have a "Darkness bar" or a "Light bar" while the hero has both
 
 - for the hero using light-based abilities increases the darkness bar and vice-versa because you have to stay "balanced"
 
 - becoming unbalanced will cause you attacks to go towards the power you have more off (like < 10 points?) but you will take more damage this contines each 10? points
 
 - after becoming completlely unbalanced you can team up with someone of the same element to do a high damage attack based on the power you are leaning towards

 - In light area Darkness is weakened and vice-versa

 - while in a light area darkness people will look weaker and (vise-versa)
